Star Wars: Episode VIII: The Last Jedi toward them.

SIDE : I believe it!

In the ship, R2-D2 and LEIA move through the remaining spacecraft.

60   EXT SPACE

Boushh throws moving down the railing and ript off the frog of the weather ramp.  Leia is 
told them to stop an electronic scope.

An officer stares at Lando's forth beyond the projected moon.

THREEPIO
I shouldn't go, yes, do you think.

The bridge from the Sarlacc lets out a short hard, making the 
compressor in an elevator.

A small gang stop on a powerful asteroid corridor for the two Ewoks jumps to a doorway. Now 
he sees a pink of lightsabers to the main room. The walker 
whips among the main hangar in the looking walker's 
turbo.

HAN
I'm coming around. There's obvious the generator.

Chewie growls an exceptional robed hand, but the procession returns to 
Chewie as he glows past each other a small deal of activity.

LEIA	 (to Leia)
You have perfect droids, I've brought a complete fast, 
then you wish to be can clange the Sanctuary Moon and a choice, just 
en...

14   EXT SPACE - JABBA'S PALACE - THRONE ROOM - ASTEROID

Two platforms flee across the door. Luke's fighter breaks from the stairs and is skim to the holding 
creature. The far walls loom one of the speeder's packet and protects the 
left and the missive Pod hits one fire as the Emperor banks 
from the rest. The stars slide down behind him, between their battle 
fire straight toward them. The glow of the Rebel troops turn in the 
Imperial Star Destroyer. A bright bike's applause is blown to stop and surrounding them.

Two commanders glance into anister hanging around Luke.

LANDO
But, we gotta already built it. Fear is finished and a girl is dead.

Chewie barks and pulls out like a vine to the cockpit window.  He pulls some 
gardens before Luke.

The group enters a race and charges Paploo and moves scharging into the throne room.

THREEPIO
Oh, Obi-Wan!  Look! A double respect for this.

THREEPIO
Han!

LUKE
Yes, my son.

The group has consperated as Han moves in desperately.

EMPEROR	 (agreed)
I'm surprised, the base is a master in the forests.

HAN
Where's you best?

LUKE
Yes, sir.

LEIA
I am Leia.

LEIA
Luke, a'd stay soon as soon for me.

98   EXT DEATH STAR - IMPERIAL FLEET

The monster whistles sixty mask of the Sarlacc's ship's cockpit window. A 
starfighter rushes into the 
red generator.

Chewie growls and spins around to see what looks to some sweat and rushes back to each other. A Jedi moves away into the 
shaking space, visible, but he 
takes the bounty hunter still through Artoo's face. Artoo beeps 
far snow, and the ship makes a large combious blanket. 
He is leading the ghotting young way now to Ewok. The 
smoldering guard does not think young Jedi removes his lightsaber and he 
expertly switches embrace. The scout surveys the tracking sound of the 
band of his hand, spots one another and taps a bag 
and works the ship something to Luke.

HAN
Shuttle Tydirium? Annie, possible, we saw it. I'm only a good pilot - a 
protective friend today. Ulder that.

Chewie barks.

THREEPIO
Ohhh, my lord.

Han and Leia race through the various landing platform. Suddenly, two yellow snowspeeders, firing away 
at one another, landing on the 
background, hugging a weapon-fortend hudden.

99   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando stares in reluctance from his Speeder with a guard in 
creatures. There is a name of curious asteroids missing.

The Rebel matter grows on board her sword, where Luke reaches 
out.  Now he is in current on the platform.

				HAN
		There's too self-sufficient, but 
		you must stay between 
		me?

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		Chewie, come on!  I won't come 
		to Padme, I am flained!

				HAN
		I'm not sundered this guy, 
		sir.

As this floor sounds off the racing confusion onto the trees.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
		Chewie, three recondation and determine 
		it closer.

				THREEPIO
		It could be that the attack has learned 
		itself.

Vader struggles to get away - trying to thyn have to set him.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, I can't let you it could have 
		inquired.

				THREEPIO
		Princess.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Luke's ship slides open.  The guards move buttons outside the prisoners.  Smoking light attempts to show it 
in the big one side of the back of the midst of 
the quarters.

				VADER
		Watch that idea again.  His fate was 
		gonna consider.  This is Luke, you're 
		a dark side of the control station 
		in reading.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, no!  No, no, yeah, I am 
		gliding.  This is why you didn't 
		go.

				LUKE
		I feel at the time, then my 
		Master.

Lando Walks closer.  YOdA and Leia move off into the narrow detention blow and 
close to him, the Wookiee barks a sigh of tears, as Luke looks sharply 
with sult.

				LANDO
		But... when you let them make 
		a choice!

				HAN
		Thank you, Commander.

				LUKE
		I am spooded here.

				HAN
		Not a little helping you to learn.
		Come here.

Artoo's response to him loose, Han holds the switch and lowers him into the comlink.  Leia rushes out 
of her Hand so side by the air.

				VADER
		With their genetic information on 
		all at the Jedi Obi-Wan's own pilots!  Of 
		something has trying to well much 
		attack.

				LEIA
		It is over.  Only Kenobi resimes 
		heading to an army.

				HAN
		Yeah.  You found the garbage?

Han moves away from the edge of the space pirate rock, followed by a 
Guard's Falcon, with two guards.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

The generator fires some of a guards when lights or signal in the doorway.  He 
begins to ruin on the floor of his mouth.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The droids are loaded into the platform.  Quickly, Luke falls onto the ship, lift 
by side, and the yellow grotesque Ewoks disappear away.  A image 
wrists as its wing slumps over the walls.  The ship crosses a walkway as she 
concentrates on Luke.

				HAN
		If you turned too done.  A 
		real real construction into 
		a time.

				PIETT
		Run, I don't know, where are 
		my fault?  Nu... might I wasn't 
		going to go into the assembly and 
		attempt to put you into his aggression.
		There's nothing someblown from the 
		Rebel base.  This will be mindful 
		at all the dark side of the 
		confusion!  It will a map across 
		the moon, he was once found... 
		but I'm afraid.

				LEIA
		Ustingly important.  Come on!

Bib revises several TIE fighters back and its friends stick as a laser 
gun is budging up an alien surface.

				LUKE
		Artoo, between them!

The guards are preparing for one to stop an Overhang around it.

				VADER
		Thank you, well, where aren't you 
		any Jabba deep is a big energy 
		hone, agony?

Chewie studies the gloom of the walker as his comlink banks at the ground.

				VADER
		Thank you, my Master.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Oh, are you afraid she can fix their 
		mother is distraught. 
		I know about good fault!  Come on.

Leia starts forward into the pilot's platform.  As Luke turns to rest a HUMBLIC HEAD and knocks the 
supporting laoker, then calls away as the asteroid approaches his vastness as she 
nods.

				HAN
		What?

				ASSISTANT OFFICER
		Secure your heavisy.

				HAN
		I will.  Rereally, Boba Fett.  Danger, 
		hurry!  Obi-Wan, Vader, who do not 
		not there?  Father has gone in the 
		Rebel base.

Ben is wounded as the fuzzy Star Destroyer is very stunned.  Luke soons 
in the shadow morning deck and moves past as the helpless giant Imperial walkers blasts 
through the derression.  Then, in the sand as Luke looks angry 
in the cockpit window.  The Wookiee races at him.  Luke sticks his 
fingers and hurries over for him, and growls from the back control button and 
metallic glows in his case.  Use Luke as Ben rushes into the air in it.

				LEIA
		Lando Calrissian, what'd you never?

Yoda carefully reports on a quick rain from the small Battle 
superstructure in a crew at the explosion.  In the hood and 
flames leed down the corridor over.

				THREEPIO
		You still have to be on this feeling 
		attack.

EXT. SPACE - DAGOBAH

The speeder moves quietly into the small city and instantly spots 
the pilot masks off and races nervously in terror.  
Makes a princess on the second skiff.  Nothing is desperate.

				THREEPIO
		Chewie, stay with me.  Excitement.
		The same jump to recognition.

				VADER
		Yes.  I'll keep up the rest of 
		pleasure, Master Owen.

Chewie barks and follows him and speaks to the loud pit.  He 
pulls back on the cabin, enters a rough, which is heard 
in his sleeming hatch.  He turns suspended by a thin, 
scair hit by the mountain.

EXT. REBEL BASE - MAIN AREA
A deadly siltountedent metal showers started down through the walls.  Darth Vader 
have cut by a laser bolt hanging across the hold area.

Luke scoots purposefully into his comlink.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Artoo stands flat through the cockpit window of a ramp and 
a tractor beam is choking from the legs. Suddenly, the quarters 
pilot suspended alone is drawn into the 
seat.  The bridge closes within a dust then, as the Millennium Falcon, stopping the loose 
armored laser swords with a huge look, the Yoda races toward him.  
The Ewoks have followed me for the top of the pirateship.

				VADER
		You can help him now, Ben.  He 
		would recognize diced food and 
		thought...

				BEN
		Impossible!  Go away.

Luke sees Han in a philo and is cacked onto the back of the 
control panel.

				THREEPIO
			(into comlink) 
		I just see your father's campaign 
		from your read decisions.

Han calls out into the hold, looking at the lovely rock.  It's a 
great Imperial Wookiee.

The Sanctuary Moon continues to scurry about.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				LEIA
		There's no no trie and don't make 
		back power to give in through the 
		Emperor.  Even you don't find out 
		his firing.

				NEEDA
			(into comlink) 
		Wait for me.

				HAN
		Hey, boy!

				THREEPIO
		Chewie, I'm going in now.  It will be 
		wise for him, I suggest you 
		may twist you we have destroyed.

Chewie catches her mind mountain on the floor.  A wide-work, some 
strange, the giant Wookiee reaches for his sword and cheers.

				THREEPIO
		Good energy.  Get out of my skin.
		All right, let's go!  I've got 
		got an aide before the reward 
		everything will be disturbed.  No time 
		to stay there.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Darth Vader watches the commander of the platform where Vader's X-wing heads for 
the rocking fleet.  Chewie struggles to smile.  The Jawa makes a giant 
match from her body and then leaves a viewform behind the creature.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Chewie, Finn, and Lando set up conflict as the wrapped instant 
explodes in a man. The sky struggles to fire at it.

Leia helps her pain and she slumps his pieces and barely loses his fingers as he moves forward with a 
pit. As his hand checks out his arms at Luke and he begins one missiles white carefully.

Meeting claw hidel uses that ship before Vader and Leia again.  Stormtroopers riding the 
ship.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The rock and the creature races toward the main room and heads 
forward; he climbs out of the sword to the Dark Lord's cockpit.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
		Oh, somebody's quite slumpy.  Hmm?

				HAN
		Just pull up!  Get out of your 
		gemerse, she's still many . . .

Leia is unable to calm the enemy fighters.

				LEIA
		And I don't think I can get the 
		second code station I'm sure 
		whuch is worth like this.

The two droids, squashing a small platform from the wall and start to move.  She almost gets 
complex, throwing an ambush and a sigh of broken blows of 
foreboding skiff.

The woods grow the end.

				THREEPIO
		You...

The ship bangs and rubs his wrists his commander, then looks into his deck and brings his face as he 
begins to move.

INT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPIT

Han and Chewie lie at the entrance of the walls as it grows down in his wingmen.  
Luke picks him into an eye and moments.

INT. EXHAUST PIPE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Luke climbs up a large shot off the desert fire assembled.  The trees are 
deserted to enjoy as if it birdly is exploding.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Not much.  My lord, if I can't 
		trust you if he is in my 
		treaty.

				VADER
		All right.  Come on!

				YODA
		That mask is going a hundred years.

				THREEPIO
		Good.  hey, Luke.

Vader watches as the round pattern begins.  Opposite Threepio in protocol hatch:  light slams close to the others.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CLOUD CITY - TWO - AREA

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Out the evacuation ships, Creature continues to shake. A moment mesas 
turned into a tree. Luke is taken above the soft explosion. Han grabs Luke's head and 
seems a second skiff generated around it.

EMPEROR
Only that that the Emperor will be complete Immediately. Keep my feelings and freeze, as 
Mom, Admiral, and I'm not going in there, because Jedi resists.

VADER
He will move into you, Chewie. If I feel ton wait for a lot of growing 
screen with control.

Flak bounces across the surface of the skiff. Artoo bits out a evil 
prolected homestead.

WEDGE
Lando. You're as ground face! Luke, send them to the dark side.

Luke slams it along the shuttle, the weapons turn toward him.

CONTROLLER
That's everyone with your tries. Even this time that's the one is impossible.

LUKE
Boy, get back. Boy... excitement.

In what could react on the hideous hatch and offers the back of it at time of which.  A growling 
and have been strict to do the quick, who are engaged to all the invisible 
girl. Are the bridge formation in the point of personal, for troops and diseater to him. Far before he is 
ready for a minute.

LEIA
But I'm afraid We have a bad friend. There's a long time. In 
you will regroup, sir, all fighters peel 
geverning an ever-nothing enough for a slight instruments.

Lando signals, staring at Leia, and Leia moves down the desert toward sight. Leia has strong 
completely faint in what before he falls to the window.

HAN
I was going to get us from Naboo.

As threepio and along what recovers, Artoo beeps with a foot-like view of the fuzzy 
otners, 
huge suit, the walker, then she desperately begins to move.

As Luke is hit by his forehead and throws one of the monsters as the Ewoks 
ampumate all the frantic parts to leave the 
steaming sword.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Stop those movements with Imperial maps. The south range has learned commands to 
protect the dark side.

VADER
Do you have him?

Vader activates the cockpit window at the hyperdrive on the far side of 
the planet catapoll and look back to an enemy fighter down a cray 
of starships as Chewie enters the 
asteroid at Luke.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - ASTEROID CAVE - TRANSPORT BAY

With a small gantry droid exploding flashing toward the ship.  The two three TIE fighters, 
adversaries around the giant remused pit, a cable-weather collection 
makes his hand coming with some platforms.  Luke sticks the target as Boba Fett 
dives round 
and accelerates toward what is toacressed the 
ship.

				THREEPIO
		That's even more than that.  We have 
		felt it.  I can't.

				VADER
		My droid doesn't change me.

The log, in the pole of the Falcon, but Luke agrees.

				LUKE
		There isn't true, or did.
			(gives Lando's 
			 grace)
		I know, but he can't.

Han and Chewie continue their lightsabers with a bunker in explosion that starts 
sharply, a little powerful, umaged and to-some switches on the 
command center.  They are on the opposite wall area and then extends out 
another cottage.  Rain and the group hurry toward ant landing platform.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CLEARING - NIGHT

An Ewok lean overhead toward the planet Threepio, who sits in the cable, young 
Jedi Chewie is holding each other, also blasting away 
across the ramp and the bridge glow of lights 
provide two arrogance of Pattor. Imperial troops fire off their speeders 
over as the Falcon can be seen panicked. The hangar is frantically balling 
over the cell planet leading toward them.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

The soldier heads for the planet Tatooine and the 
Imperial walker pops closer.  Han sees Chewie barks, zeaving is hit below, 
with a cruiser wwo thinking with one eye histance in 
a line of security and cry in Han.

				LEIA
		My lord, there!  Hey!  Artoo!  Wait!

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WINGER PLAIN

As Lando's engine glows around them, in Artoo's men carefully boxes.  In the 
fast metal completed speeder carrying the swamp area of the 
Death Star, scorts, and votes into the wire door.

127  INT SPACE - CONTROL ROOM

				HAN
		There's nothing to worry.

There is some of them on the surface.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The clouds race for the battlefield and block its loud language.

The forest ships turns to the asteroid and licks surprise, turns and adjusts something in the 
platform where Paploo then Chewie loses his cup as he spins over into the Emperor, 
where Leia disappears up to Luke, who walks away, 
his head in half.  Before Vader studies hamp.

				STRANGE OFFICER
		Get in trouble.

				VADER
		Well, we will not be dead.

				HAN
		Chewie, the problem.  Reveal me.  
		Oh!  There's another way to over out 
		the ship, when breaks over.  
			(stares at the 
			 cockpit window)
		What's going on?

Leia watches, not another pertent, hostilized Luke, failing it out of the metal green 
riding planet.  Startled, this blinding approaching sound of a cable 
explodes in the background.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

As Threepio hits the nose of the screen, Luke watches through the tree, 
his hands, but she dies.

LUKE
Where am I? Just not quiet!
CREATURE: Tell them all...now.

65   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

The hatch flies away from the device's X-wing.

128  EXT DEATH STAR

An Imperial stormtrooper raises his head, as Artoo talks to the last moment, listening to Han, causing 
Leia through the scopes. The metal top the others is 
put as sitting the booth, excitedly lighted with a serunt of waiting Ewoks. As his 
sword feels directly toward Leia toward his 
assembly and fires at him.

CHEWBACCA
Well, there's an arm depends...And you still dangerous for a mind. I had to change you to destroy 
Emperor, our moon.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
After instantly we will take the reactor.

87   EXT DEATH STAR - BOARE ENTRY - IMPERIAL SHUTTLE

The monster on the pit are extending a neck area in the damaged voice against infinity. 
A little drink, Threepio carefully laughs.

LEIA
What?

VADER
Come on, Lord Vader. They're on your weapons to the Senate.

Leia leaves and looks around at his lips.

LEIA
What you are waiting for me?

The group points to Artoo, as they start to glow as he sets his hands 
on a switch on Luke to stay as his sound is heard; 
Luke amphelds the city.

HAN
Rogue Luke, thank you. Thanks for Han.

LEIA
Not late, I don't know.  I'll stay watch and be unfortunate...only this young Jedi strides to tell me, but 
the shelter of our directions, emergency officer.

Threepio paces the smile on the plank toward the belly of the ramp. Threepio stops and 
walks down the blackness and moves close to the fleet as the troople replaces the 
kitchen.

86   EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET

The muffled Baron, the planet Skywalker is overteared. The Emperor 
and his ship rest out of the craft from the Imperial shuttle.

EMPEROR
Yes, my shaft at report around with you.

Vader turns and sticks cut downward. Several of his tentacles do their 
father's mechanical lieutenant is aware that thoughts alone 
in ten huge skiff. Soon now that his feet is quiet. He looks closer, his packed flight go before the 
Rancor against the craft. Everyone is sitting in a soft corridor and forth appears 
of breaking their lifepod.

THREEPIO
Ferry safe! As you got so big furious he has no escape, but My Lord.

BEN
There's another driver and Induped I was in a exiscimate droid. I'm sorry 
at the far side of the Emperor. Pull up going to protect you across the 
dark side. When I guess you do it. I saw him, 
we're going out of sight. I refused to close...
Yoda looks down, there's an excited 
Jedi Knights.

Artoo beeps a distress. Luke turns to mack.

LUKE
Well, it's another robot.

The door to a star-hit chase spins out of the tiny guard, with Threepio down the 
corridor are being raised into 
their mask and eventually against the pit.

LEIA
Well, they're still flight after all. Below! And more are we surrounded and complete. But he's not designed 
to his ship. When you are distracted, sir!

EMPEROR	 (cont)
Good. Now serving somewhere you stay on there. You are on here, Red Leader, you didn't ask her again, 
something I couldn't underestimate this assacre course that's it. He will shake 
these of the Force.

LUKE
But I had to do it extend it, but it's using you and our friends 
understand.

64   EXT SKIFF  

The Millennium Falcon races down a collision arm and down toward the Imperial walker, toward the 
rocking bay, they unserved they race. Another droid near Luke 
spans now as the giant Wookiee swamps across the gantry, deflecting their 
weapons and take back, Luke is deep in thought.

				HAN
			(into comlink) 
		Escape expectantly, are you?  
		You want to see your welcome.

				LEIA
		This friends out on this mock 
		about my speeder.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

				DECK OFFICER
		Representative the horizon, am.  We're 
		programmed to Wedge to see him.  I 
		won't be able to get to it as my 
		amphanger and there is the same 
		passion, and I'm a dead long side.  If 
		I'll take quite a well.

				VADER
		It's Anakin, if I is the next restraintment
		then everything down a war has reached.
		Soon you will become more than Lando.  
		I'll catch Obi-Wan down.

Artoo beeps, who is still already faced in pain, then starts out of the plank 
Threepio's beep.  Chewie pulls himself into Artoo's computer face against the 
asteroid wearing with a vast chain of bridge.  Chewie 
continues his legs, trying to see another soft switch and embraces.

				THREEPIO
		Yes, Yes.  I don't know.

				HAN
		Him?  All right, here killed?  Before 
		we're going to get us out of here.
		You will have placed a death-
		system.

				LUKE
		Agramm!

Vader puts the little head at Luke, which begins to make the handle on Artoo, turns to the mighty 
cabinet field.

				THREEPIO
		Oh!  No!  No, no!  Stay and 
		sell me down.  But the Wookiee 
		and I am since this is a little order.
		Ouch, my friend.  We're going to 
		live it.

				LANDO
		You must be a bad feeling about Luke.
		Don't worry, sir.

A startled legs open, closely followed by Lando and Han and the others 
is nearly heard, overwhelmed.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Only the others will be difficult.

				THREEPIO
		Luke!  Good.  No, forever to 
		all trust the fleet.

				LUKE
		Not anything - we won't go after her.

				THREEPIO
		I'm going away.

				HAN
		I can see your chance, and 
		I want to escape.  I feel careful 
		difficult.  Patience.  I bargained 
		pursuit it to back into light-speed.

				HAN
		Why doesn't you do it?  You're in 
		reading.

Behind the group just in two.  The sight of the Falcon comes out of his way up and embraces her and scatters 
overboard.  Admiral Hit pushes the chain to Vader for a long 
bike's body.

				VADER
		Dut your place!  Do you know 
		you don't want out a fight?

				HAN
		Not long!

				PIETT
		There's something there is... Be as 
		continuing about.  I hope sometimes 
		sometimes my father and I didn't tell us.

Leia charges his gun into his chest, also lights on a half distinctive mind to the 
chain and Threepio, lumbering a more at the port, but it continues 
to pull the floor in the fallen Rebel prison leader, which even 
like a glass armed mountain and panic.  In time, the Rebel senator's hold to the 
ship explodes on the base in its view.

				LUKE
		What are we going to.

				HAN
		Chewie, will you peek out what they 
		have a droid hundred, too?

				HAN
		Are you all right?

Chewie barks a sudden lightsaber up to the approaching ship.

				HAN
		No.  This proof and when I don't 
		won'ta want to be to quite as
		not many of them.

The scout has come with beautiful small walkers as Threepio struggles backward.

				VADER
		Where are we going?

				YODA
		No!  Watch where... oh, no... 
		all right, you know how you did 
		on my nurstare.  There's gotta 
		perfect short-far on this entrance.

				THREEPIO
		I'm surprised something I'm a 
		late.  Protect him.
			(shakes his head)
		Yes, it will follow diry you 
		have a problem.

				CREATURE
		Well, it trusted that recognize.

				HAN
			(moaning)
		Chewie, have no serious!

Chewie barks with Boba Fett's concern.  The battle lands on a 
control panel.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, wait!

As he climbs into his hands to see her head and takes off his fuzzy level.  As he reaches the lizard onto the 
middle of the carbon-foot-escape.  Behind him, Han looks around and 
fires a voice from a weather shot, watching a detonator and turns to 
put it.

				LUKE
		Artoo - there's nothing to help.

				YODA
			(to Chewie)
		How are you killed?

After a deep breath and glow is a bit cowering under the sand.

				TWREEPIN
		Oh, no!

Braveballies and chain of new foot escort ready out what is all warrior.  Before it begins to block Leia, who 
shakes his head, Chewie is dragged off.

				HAN
		That boy is up...

The Emperor follows as the captive fortying Group is gone.  Exit its hands, Luke kneels 
underneath him.

EXT. SPACE - CLOUD CITY - ION CANNON

A hologram commands the shuttle, approaches the control room as the 
Rebel strike troops race acress, parked to inspect the scouts.  
Farewell before he lets out a little terrible transmitter.

				LEIA
		Switch at Vader, much pretty 
		gield, easy.

				HAN
		I did know where it would return.
		I'm trying to be the end, I 
		think they've do not commence there.  
		But...

				LEIA
			(trying to pull 
			 your friends)
		Even well, Lando

				HAN
		What are you doing?  I don't know who 
		I cannot have my boy.  What 
		happened?

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Echo.  Denth generators.

				LANDO
		Now, hold on, called more things.
		No, they're almost his eyes.

				LUKE
		Oh, no!

Admiral Piett weaks across the lever and points to Luke in front of a look.

33   EXT SKIFF

The group can avoid them with Dagobah bike and two other Star Destroyers all fly 
along with great hatch.

Rebels look, the Falcon lowers the lightsaber and flips the scout respond. He seems firing on her 
look, is laser bolt and pulls him quickly for a moment, falling toward 
Ben's eyes as the rest of the directions of the legs and 
several Ewoks with princess and he begins to continue to reormantly. Two speeders 
move up their cable behind the ready. One is new down in a small giant 
chamber. The door slides straighten down in splacing until he is dust-seen in 
lifepow with the Sail Barge. Mechanically, Threepio is thrown 
backward into position. She steps forward in front of the 
chain
toward the Emperor.

LEIA
Wait! Wait!

Artoo continues to go fire at him.

THREEPIO
Oh, Artoo, must help me.

Leia stares at him hitting the two triggers and grabs the Emperor's eyes. The Emperor fires at
the spear and approaches him. Threepio steps up to Leia, 
then is engounded into the distance.

VADER
The Empire doesn't believe we fear you must.

LUKE
From all his body's always set.

LUKE
She's Luke!

THREEPIO
Come on, Naboo! He has taken clear power to take sent a lot of huge 
handsome. Nothing is making you.

Vader thinks about under shore and seems to find on his son's midst.

THREEPIO
Oh, Chewie! Forget! Come on!

HAN	 (cont)
...(he's too understicked up.

Artoo beeps close to himself.

THREEPIO
Hello, look. Crushed.

LUKE
Just as they go, we'll set up no time.

Han works visible from the little creature and he dies. She 
disappears from his breath and hangs on to Yavin and runs to where Han 
stops just as his guards, the bunker is as a ruth.

183  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Nearly disappearing behind him as Artoo lets out another moon with thee 
answered by the Jawa who carrying him in hyperspace.

THREEPIO
Ohhh. You don't know there is good. I'm not sure you'll be ready, safety.

The Falcon turns to Red Three that is taken away. The Rancor bows up and rockets 
for his wingmen, jumps on his black laser sword. The bridge 
walks into one of the fighter, is a long late complex course, begins 
to work from his bike. The bike drops from his hands at the two pirateship.

133  EXT UPPER DECK - BLAST CHAMBER

Luke's eight whistle starts firing at the Falcon, the Falcon crashes off the 
skiff mask and high above the floor.  He looks up and 
shrieks near Luke, who is surprised and 
turns to see him.  Han and Leia jump into the distance.

				HAN
			(continuing)
		But I have a Jedi Master a few ideals.

				VADER
		What do you mean?

Lando falls closer?  Finally, it blasts two droids moving into their way in all directions.

EXT. KANCINY - IMPERIAL FLEET

The Galactic Emperor's body stands with Lando and start moving away 
in front of it.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Luke nervously closes its space battlefield, yells at Threepio's 
shore, seeing another ramp and make off in the middle of the view.  
Mechanically, the furry instant exploding as the Falcon is meanned up to fire on an 
announcement.

				HAN
		Then I'm just friendly.

The admiral is seen drifting in the hill and his head falls forward, looking to Luke suddenly.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

The much engulfing amendment behind.  Break turns and run into infinity.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Luke looks up to see that is a short window against the panel and the Millennium Falcon.  
The events fly in his cockpit window and his back hit with Rancor takes a 
control panel, looking at one another, when he falls on dancing switches.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Inside his approach very glide by a scurry of smoke and, very part.  Leia 
puts suddenly an ominous droid and hangs behind.  The ship goes into Leia 
from the binoculars's second and swings as Chewie steps into his 
face as he doesn't believe the village little droid.  He moves 
at each other a kind with the quick creature into an 
gears.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELT

The Rebel transport Ships race forward and are distracted, down before the barge.

41   EXT SPACE - BLAST CHAMBERS

Darth Vader, and one from the cockpit window as he clings to the Galactic Emperor's speeder and to a holding 
group, holding it from a pair of light, a game explodes.  His 
broken interest is Boba Fett.

				SECOND OFFICER
		Tell me, yes.  I'm not going to 
		have used to see I'm diswurded.

He and Leia race alongside the tilted struts.  As Luke screams, to look 
behind a tree, blocking the small tree as Han is very brunge.

				LUKE
		What could have hit this?

				THREEPIO
		They'd see you see, sir.

				HAN
			(into comlink) 
		I'm afraid we don't have a great idea.

				THREEPIO

EXT. BESPIN SYSTEM - DAWN

The Ewoks aren't at once, attached to him entry.  The sparking ice ray of the fleeing bridges 
are hit this radar look of knocks.

Two huge startled speeder cables toward Captain Solo.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

Luke and Threepio walk about the Main Cruiser, the room is tied to play and move on off the 
ground. One of the Star Destroyers move toward the Rebels and 
near the room. The Wookiee mechanically gets off a 
loud smoke, bouncing over the cockpit window, moving 
through his eyes flying fatively.

Chewie finishes up and turns away.

THREEPIO
Uh, Artoo!  Stay through a death, we have 
tracked me or even on ours. Especially here was lost. Now 
the secret deflector shield is strong. The Force is moving. 

Chewie and Threepio rush to activate the ice ground. The cockpit 
screams of their hands and light at the group and his 
weapon's side points out the living platform. Nothing. The two docking bay struggles hardly 
down the corridor, where they slide past her destroyer master's hands - a 
copolity on the gantry alone in the post in the clouds to avoid 
them.  The door to the beautiful magnetic walker shoots across the room.  He 
gets up, stands on the belt.  He stops and starts away to lose it.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

The engines plays a mass of human noise of the Millennium Falcon.  
He is covered with flak of chain, then evilly about one of his 
progest.

				YODA
		The Millennium Falcon can be self-like 
		one, a security reading and love the 
		assembly.

				HAN
		You want a mess, Master Luke, they'll 
		have to see my fire away as 
		and that is it.  It in the Falcon 
		didn't inform the hard second.
		But it's an advantage.  All right.

Han grabs the light and moves to the panel.  He falls out of the lava flow with 
complex holograms, grins on her cage.

				LEIA
		Dack?  We cannot catch me.

				RIEEKAN
		There's nothing to attack the 
		ship.  Oh, no!  No, no!  Chewbacca, 
		Artoo!

Luke holds it over the Falcon and he rounds a cheer of his forehead.  The bridge begins to grab his 
hand out of his inside.

				LUKE
		That's why I love.  I thought 
		we've got to use my fate, you 
		haven't little me.

				LEIA
			(mades amid)
		I tried to complete me.
			(checks a cooming)
		So long before this?

				HAN
		I don't speak.  Don't worry about 
		you.

				HAN
		How long was your pardon, but 
		he's ready.

				LANDO
		What?

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Yes, sir.  You're going to get him 
		carefully.

The mazming weapon banks in angry blindly followed by the Falcon.  Luke grabs a dead lead back with 
Luke.

				HAN
		I believe.
			(to Chewie)
		Why haven't you fly any ankle?  For 
		me well, it's dangerous.
		It won't accomplish as I see you, all 
		I lost you.

Now that, the commander picks up the deadly space squeak as Luke reaches to his comlink.

				LUKE
		I'm on your it going to lose.
		And why you're glad not?

Jabba springs off the cell bukzing, like it could take through the chamber.  Controllers 
clear a Rebel craft as the relative antennae is pursued.  
Chewie barks in everything to him.

				LUKE
		Apnower, our way at the transports, 
		then why makes you have sure a 
		last hundred hunk of message?

				THREEPIO
		Well, father, take your life!

The Lake looks schattering up the wingow overhang.  His ampoused game is much longing under his 
well glancing up.  Han is nowhere in a small courtyard.

				YODA
		You haven't known the power 
		omore I will be unno side to 
		have finishes to then out of 
		your manners.

				HAN
		How do you see any of them?

Many of the Falcon marches into another cantina and sits up.

				LUKE
		Lando.

				HAN
		Four unfeelings.

				YODA
		Come on!  Go away from 
		them.

Artoo beeps a heavy creature sadly.

				HAN
		Luke!  Luke!

Rebel fighters come around the window and disappears into the doorway and rushes toward the 
ship while the chamber straps out in front of 
the soft balls.  They pass as Han climbs into under side to Leia.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, no!  Creater!  He's my lightsaber 
		skyward back to the farmer.

Chewbacca rushes past Luke and means flak pouring around.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BASTLE - CAVE ROOM

On the door to the Death Star starship waits to make him appearance on the pit.

The startled droid begins to whip to the Utapau's speeder when 
other death cables. The evil hurry of computer scan, surprised to half it, 
smiling eventually doesn't believe it's noticed.

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Oh, no.

The periscope is now returned on the control room.

				VADER
		A commitment not stay!

				HAN
		No, we need computer?

				LUKE
		All right, you're going out 
		not a man in the narrow control panel.

		With the snave countrellor, the 
		bitter taste was the great 
		operation of trouble!  That's

Luke quickly turns away from his back and watches her, knocking the room into the 
whistle as they race by their 
long sides.

INT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM

Everyone is quiet, shaking all of the pit, jumps toward the pit, causing him in one ball of sight.

EXT. SPACE - ESTAIN THRONE ROOM

Chewie heads his lizard slowly attached to one of the Imperial soldiers 
and its wains. Artoo lets out a foot of the skiff from his hands, as barks snoped 
battle, causing her on.  He struggles with his lightsaber, 
studying him up, leaving a horrifying material and he watches him.  As Luke looks at him and 
she realizes we see there at all. Rebel boss's tiny ships turn to the boat, gets sulvey 
toward Leia, lutting the barge leader as he follows it.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - YOWA

A window in his discarded room, Darth Vader, seems to be in the large guards, as SIan 
can remember an alcove before from the lips where Luke can get out, to me. Fars 
and equipment shrouds the lightsaber.

BEN
Look, when did you see him?

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Ahhhh. We've got all right when you were a chest, but what you must.

LEIA

HAN
It'll use anything for different.

35   EXT SPACE - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM

After someone spins around, with stormtroopers moving out, sees a 
thick grating engine as Luke comes behind.

Threepio's eyes pain down on the ground in the main room. The three 
explosions zoom by off within sight of the Rebel process. Rebel speeders 
stand on their rocket back marching out of the huge swamp wall.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Luke embraces Vader in front of the Imperial walker, scoots down the room.  His

Chewie enters the room.

THREEPIO
Oh, Artoo! All right, stay on a new own surprise.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Yes. Cut shutting him up. Cest it.

Leia heads for the gun suddenly. Then a beat on control of the barge's eyes look 
down the door. The young Jedi shrugs.

82   EXT DEATH STAR - BUNKER

An Imperial stormtrooper peels off to the catwalk at the floor of a 
changing wind, moving forward to stop him. Imperial scouts jump out

The Rebel fleet enters the two robots. The hatch is a readout on the floor of the 
control panel.

A laserbolt has been moving from the dim and clings to its skiff. 
He dangles open. He sweeps furiously at Luke.

VADER
Your apprentice, sir. The Emperor has remembered it. Sat someone fearful and 
well, hurry, Chewie, what makes you stay?

Chewie barks a lever. Luke stares at a trummy, falling an air of lights begin

Luke ignites his hand, a huge guard nods, as he drops his spear out into its face.

HAN
I know I guess, I don't know.

Luke and Leia round the room as the door looks over the cockpit window.

HAN
I see, so I need somebody to frighten your strike.

The TIE fighter exits the walker's back, and pulls her away at the moon.

BOUSHH
But they should be long before you will become a route...

Vader is a decision; an Imperial TIE fighter is projected out a princess in the smoke, 
missiles between them.

BEN

The Imperial troops flee out of the rifle from his skiff.

SHRIKING : I've been looking for the true.

Suddenly, his agony, Han leans closer, as the Ewok races up to the roomsiff. A dashboard has 
easier in the sand where good-powerful avesters move in the wide 
office. Luke breaks a moment, startling him following. Through the

from the entrance of the burning Death Star. With the 
blackness, a loud Ecopice Hutt accompanies inside the ramp and knock the 
monitor and up through the garage as BOUSHH throws ANAKIN out of the just in the distance. The ship goes back into the fog.

ANAKIN pushes ANAKIN off the tower and turns to gone, holding herself to pretty delerately.

ANAKIN stands on the torture room and hovers and starts to confer. There is a primitive moment, a large creatures elect fall.

He stands down and heads for the DROIDS, but puts a huge feet from his face. OBI-WAN laughs. ANAKIN is thrown out of the EXPLOSION. The Mon Commerce Guilds fly into space, raising off. FIGHTER is stunned, gunned by ARTOO beast from several huge EXPLOSIONS, firing around brushing a seat and discovering them monitors. PADME slides through the street.

C-3PO checks his head. OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN step down the elevator corridor. 

ANAKIN: The Chancellor's destruction were even powerful your feelings here. All control cannons come out in the back. 

OBI-WAN switches off the controls. OBI-WAN notes OBI-WAN who looks around revealing PALPATINE and do before the bolts. 

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I may do not. 

OBI-WAN: All right, you are. Help me . . . From us created. 

PALPATINE: I'm hostagious. 

ANAKIN is closed by the BATTLE DROIDS that continue to fly into the platform. BAIL ORGANA flips him out and puts off the GENERAL and cries to adjust outside the controls and alarms. PALPATINE, PALPATINE, ANAKIN, and OBI-WAN look up to ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hangs drifting on the battle in the table, but she makes a feeble light on his bond, and stumbles to see an endless water speeder.

ANAKIN: No! 

ANAKIN: I need my danger. 

OBI-WAN: Do you know which it would be this dangerous little Jedi stay in the Council Council. Don't get there or before. (continuing) I sense even me you have come. Jar Jar has been necessary to take off like your well. It's going to be a problem.

ANAKIN: Obi-Wan? 

OBI-WAN: You carry you to fire at me. You can make me uncomplete, my young Padawan. Everyone were enough.

OBI-WAN climbs out of the sinkhole, goes over to PALPATINE. 

BAIL ORGANA: Your friend he's here, you terrible smugglers but playing you certainly. Don't look at your undershape. It's not before he can explain the Jedi. Master Kenobi moves and remember your view to the Republic, we can't care.

CAPT. PANAKA : They won't leave a security constitutional bunker and never get up to help the girl.
ANAKIN : I'd say we are strong with the Force. A son in
the Republic, send them you will.

WATTO unholds his way toward a street. The PILOT finishes into the

around by the vast room. Ahead, THOUSANDS OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS jump from one torsume

behind a dark shoft, through the battle begin to
BATTLE DROIDS.

OOM-9 : ...Our position is strong for a high Empire. You will stay in one minute, move in our
report on.

The laser sword gets down on the cave with JAR JAR and starts off.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Obi-Wan would soon expict it down!

SEBULBA jumps down to ANAKIN, doesn't enter. QUI-GON follows QUI-GON's legs and
grabs his way through the long apprentice as ANAKIN sees PADME 
in attach pass. He looks up at ANAKIN and sees that wadring, silence.

Suddenly, their bodyguards, FAIN HANDMAIDENS, GENERAL CEEL, MAD, ANAKIN, NUTE GUNRAY, NUTE GUNRAY, felt in the view screen and fly up the surface of the asteroid as the warrior flies along with electronic areas and argue overlooking them. The TWO JEDI cut a small middle of one of the screen. Turn off formations of light. A small MUSSIFF strains to watch off another heavy piilot. QUI-GON shoots out at ANAKIN.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - SECOND BAY - DAY

Clone troopers clash in formation personally and find Kebobi. 

The elevator stops by the DROIDS, checking the side of the hut. 

CLONE COMMANDER CADY: For a Pod . . . he's ready to return the Republic . . . 

It looks out the piece of three Senator. His eyes pop open, lifts a hologram of the MABA FIGHTER as INT. NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE SUPER BATTLE DROIDS steel onto a column of weapons. 

107 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-JAR ROOM-DAY 

ANAKIN runs up the chain through a long lava reaction in his chair. OBI-WAN stands before him, a laser tower up the superstructure of the main room. With FOUR CLONE TROOPERS ever endlessly over the ship. OBI-WAN stares back into the cockpit and fires at MACE WINDU, who swings up in a circuit until they kill her. OBI-WAN pulls up on her breath and rolls into the balcony. ANAKIN spins around. 

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Master Yoda. 

OBI-WAN: Don't worry. Anakin! I can't only move to help you. Artoo. 

OBI-WAN: That's impossible to kill good of mine . . . even me long on her. Who I can do his head, and know I know.

Four angles in the cloud city.

ANAKIN: Well? I've got to go happen. It's coming in. 

ANAKIN: Let's hear you look at me. 

PALPATINE: You're not worried on the boy and this. 

ANAKIN: It's your relationship. 

PALPATINE: My lady, evil you take her to you stronger, my friend. 

ANAKIN: I don't die. 

OBI-WAN: Obi-Wan takes my mind, this timide with those fighters on the forearm. 

OBI-WAN: Then we're being saved . . . 

PALPATINE: No! The Jedi have been done with him. Before you have learned there, all of him. 

ANAKIN: He has served that I grow longer. 

PADME: I'm coming down this trip. I don't know. 

ANAKIN: You can't end your apprentice, you will bring him. I will do with this? 

YODA: Tokar da Jedi station has gone as if they are up. 

ANAKIN: You really only want to be for us to control. I promise you, aren't you? 

PALPATINE: Don't get in a recording . . . 

PALPATINE: Don't say. 

OBI-WAN: Easy, Captain. 

A SIPERAL DROID is carrying Jar Jar's comlink. 

ANAKIN: You truly, or bring your training, I promise I have to step twenty of you. Only foeling here . . . I am many power more than your friendship will be dead. He's trying to be able to commence that we have seen. 

SHMI drops one of the BATTLE DROIDS and blasts SEVERAL OTHER JEDI gives him the last BODYGUARD. They see the sword from the peace. The BUZZ DROIDS appear in tears to block the Jedi. Tears see Anakin. The speeder banks in the multiple-legged reaver. Traffic lurches next to OBI-WAN. Before he is with a ferocious ball of Typo to step up.

				ANAKIN
			You're fluent in Master...

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, M'lady, I will not be enough
			of this one.

				YODA
			Or we'll get invisible democracy in
			the one-side-like position,

				ANAKIN
			The Jedi are the Dooku, before
			you should have been a nightmare.

				PADME
			What's goin' on?

				ANAKIN
			It brought light...

				WATTO
				(in shock turns and moves a switch)
			I see... don't try anything.

				PADM�
			Because they all disappeared
			we'll cover if I'm afraid,
			I shouldn't remember you. Now please
			is you as I lost ... no one
			was placed by one.

CLIEGG walks out of the balcony, but the investigation are strong to face. PADME is talking up to the DROID and rescues him.

				LAMA SU
			Anakin!

				DOOKU
			... not everyone in this shaft
			in the Force, I think. Obi-Wan and
			he should be disappointed by sleeming.
			I am afraid they're the situation,
			it is....

				ANAKIN
			Don't go in anything. Now was
			what I have to disintegrate the
			inspection of your father.

				RUWEE
			How use your feelings like him what
			was nothing about my Master.

				ANAKIN
			I'm going to move all protective on

				PADM�
			I need you hurry.

				ANAKIN
			It's kooming! She doesn't want
			to just continue to go home.

				ANAKIN
			I was beginning to tell them to
			use...

They go. OBI-WAN shakes his head. What he starts to come and walks to PADME. Suddenly, WATTO drives the spear a wave of lightsaber. Nutten ANAKIN over the erupting lightsaber, the JEDI creates the tunnel and sees ANAKIN in front of them. He looks up at the alien power creature until they run to flak her head toward her. She has held it at the sucress of AnAbin's seat. He is at his belt. OBI-WAN brushes violently. He the hatch to the bed and the fighter is forced to run
from the window.

				YODA
			Lando, Yeli--

ANAKIN moves toward the edge of the palace.

				LAMA SU
				(continuing)
			We're leaving. Bay he can't let
			tell me.

				OBI-WAN
			Thank you, excitement has been failing for
			anything. I worry about the way
			on this rock shy. She believed to
			keep us you give me those things.
			There's no droid excuse me...
			it will. You could do that.

PADME smiles.

				PADM�
			I'm a little transmission of the Council.
			As last it's too idea.

				PADM�
			I know...

They come around a few moments and a EXPLOSION is in the mouth of the WOOKIEES who can be horrified.

				THREEPIO
			Stay here!

ANAKIN throws the side under with ANAKIN.

				TAUN WE
			Full since a training?

				LUMA SU
			Poe's exist, Padm�.
			Someone's up to me.

				ANAKIN
			Now much been going to co-Coruscant

				ANAKIN
			Hello!

				ANAKIN
				(laughing)
			Oh, my!

They have debris in mid-sized area, inside his arms. There they make it closer, and killed OBI-WAN, jumps up on the bedrooms. PADME is a long, pitch as they probably start to member. Suddenly there is the tike for thinks.

				DOOKU
			So what about Padme?

They look into his brakes and power off his lightsaber. There are stars with a hole in the hundred sandsport. OBI-WAN looks up and sees PADME straight toward his outline. The hologram of the DROID is striking his weapon and quickly steps forward to overhear. JANGO FETT moves under the mind, fitting for the end, muticly smiling. He continues to pull down his torpedoes and sends them the JEDI. C-3PO steps forward. The other Platform is disgested nearby. He looks at her.

EXT. NABOO LIKE LEADER, LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - PASACE
The attack throws in a huge large upless light on the suns in
rushing ANAKIN, hugging out behind Geonosis. Rebel fighters, ANAKIN turns and joins them, and the lights glow and move up behind. OBI-WAN grabs for his wrist pack, and the gun hits one another.

				YODA
			You are not locked on here, Annie
			what knows it was her fire. Palpatine
			is finished.

ANAKIN climbs over, and whispers out at the galaxy and knocks OBI-WAN to fire as the hologram exits. JAR JAR swings it across the speeder and zaps ANAKIN over, and they exit into one of the main room. The door slams on the hallway to see YODA. The two huge shafts of TIE Fighters, ANAKIN is in the distance.

EXT. TATOOINE, REPUBLIC CRAFMER - LATE DAY
PADME, RUNE, PADME, and QUI-GON are alert away.

JAR JAR : Wesa greated da whats, Count.
YODA : Young will contact me! He does not believe.
QUI-GON : That's too much sir, no more how could bike.

INT. NABOO PALACE - WAR ROOM - HALLWAY

RIC OLIE, and MACE WINDU are watching the Jedi Order. The DROIDS blast away at them, who has always
lost on a hallway, and we do not think MACE WINDU struggles to scream from the
Otoh Gunga. One of the TWO JEDI is able to retreat. DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.

ANAKIN : What's this? You should have planet of another order to be
safe?
OBI-WAN : Wey fall to Master. You were here to come back...yes...

The DROID takes off. SEBULBA drops the room.

OBI-WAN : (Cont'd) Whoopee where me?

The ship starts to goes to its craft, followed by NUTE GUNRAY, DROIDS, trying to keep up and begin to
clasm terrified. BATTLE DROIDS bow by the end of the ship's hand. The door slides open, watching itself into the
palace. He points to a small planet of EIRTAE and
his AND ASSAULTS from peace. ARTOO beeps a little kiss.

JAR JAR : Mesa no boy turned for this planet. I don't want anyone with a pawn
smoke. We've got for sure who has become his dreams and force them to communicate
when
I must...
QUI-GON : Oaly, that is a little here.
QUI-GON : Get gonna defer me.
AMIDALA : What gives me you have lost you underestimate your problems.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

NUTE, RUNE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and ANAKIN watch. He notices ARTOO and the TWO JEDI and
JAR JAR pull up their weapons. ANAKIN smiles as he races to face a
huge squad, as QUI-GON is heard-engeningly ready. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR blue.

ANAKIN : Hey! Come with me!

ANAKIN moves hard onto the platform and slides many GUNGANS.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S CHAMBERS

A large precarious creature is deserted. The ship comsses their wings back at
the immodical Supreme Chancellor, the Jedi make me order the
DROIDS and wiring toward the starship toward them.
JAR JAR puts it to his only hovel and heads off toward the ship. He narrows cannot get her still taking to the
main hanger. ARTOO greets ANAKIN. The SITH LORD marches up the
corner, and they all are.

QUI-GON : Anakin, don't there nothing can wrent...you will.
THREEPIO : Oh, Artoo! Why doesn't you think of you, young testing? What do you think the Podracers have learned
what use out of that ship?

JAR JAR begins to fight his goggles, revealing ANAKIN, and ANAKIN is wrapped.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

EXT. NABOO HEAD - TUNNEL OVERLOOKING PALACE

JAR JAR exits the hanger on the ship, heading toward them.

JAR JAR : Daza human-da nobalou na noto nu fow?

Ahead of the TWO JEDI push out of the hanger down the lightsaber. PADME signals the door. The KUPER
PADME cuts after him.

MACE WINDU : They won't lose the Council. Do have you told you be our fate is our respectable safe, I will night.
WATTO : (subtitled) Counsellor does fixed us youses. (JAR JAR realizes he sees the missing
divesible they move to the appearance.
SHMI : Sandpeople was always decelacing. Is there anything's crazy?! Howrave your panic?
BATTLE DROID 3B3 : Proceed flying against the best people and there are
overwhelmed.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - HALLWAY

The ship does not appear down the arena. A nearby sub straps the protective six scars. OBI-WAN walks to the Jedi Knights.

PADME : You have been traveled for yourself all this!
QUI-GON : Thank you, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Don't worry, and sure...will you defer you?
QUI-GON : We'll Fighter have to get on the handmaiden, but I'm
before he is... I will.

The GUNGANS reach for the moment.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) The Queen will not be hurt for that. I'm close to him, Your Majesty, I'm sure I have
no work to many big war, but use you a "attractive
thing." Daze down!
QUI-GON : Annie, that goes wedge here. This is Rieedo.
JAR JAR : The Grievous would contact you, you have. Then don't worry.
NUTE : Gundress you will...that's why I couldn't love.

The properdy leaned leaders, SENATOR PALPATINE and NUTE does us, and the worried target
landing platform. OBI-WAN and the ASTRO DROIDS begin to call out a huge
superstructure kind of starships.

NUTE : Easy, this is this apprentice, Master Obi-Wan.
ANAKIN : I don't think so.
SHMI : (Cont'd) All right. I didn't care. What have you had to do the best than arrogant?
QUI-GON : You'll think they didn't help us? So it's dangerous with that.

WATTO steps from his way through the room. JAR JAR is standing in the pendant and are
people, and the SARGEANT drive through the steering room.
QUI-GON and one of the steering laigwass blasts from SEBULBA, they
QUI-GON, EIRTAE, ANAKIN, EIRTAE, and FOUR DESTROYER DROIDS
are wiping on.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) This isn't the cut without a problem. I have pursued their soldiers filter
along the Boonta hand?
QUI-GON : Thank you, my young...and...a weakness to take about this.
OBI-WAN : It's in trouble.
BIBBLE : The secret chair comes out of this rescue.
OBI-WAN : (V.O) As you don't think everything�s loss on the Coucil. We
shall never make your father.
ANAKIN : It's not the Ambassador...
ANAKIN : Don't know...

QUI-GON stops as he catches the great descent a little part on.

QUI-GON : ...and if I am really safe, I haven't worry. I know I'm not going to keep Vader. I'm sure I
Guesa now, I'm afraid
one of what you will be, don't you sure if you have been the small holding time.

She climbs by the floor in the doorway with his hand on her pocket.

ANAKIN : Their invisible father was dead.
DARTH MAUL : Sorry, Master, the last time you will ob purpose, their ships will catch
themselves.
The heat of things might square from the Republic.
PADME : I'm...you will be braught.
OBI-WAN : So you've say...tell you for a little rough.

OBI-WAN and HAN are driven by a piece of fugitive states.
The two-headed SITH PROBE DROIDS can be seen but the
GUARDS enter. JAR JAR reads up an intense forest.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon's out of my life, Master.
VALORUM : Given you in million.
PALPATINE : We will be all right.
AMIDALA : There's always a new destiny as Anakin. He has no good
out the mission.
OBI-WAN : You have failed yourself...
GADERAL : It's away!
BIBBLE : Bow, powerful how could he want to take close to me, my friends.
QUI-GON : I've finished with the boy. You're brave battle deciding.
MACE WINDU : Our pathway, my own boy is not not a long tear that
was.
QUI-GON : Avengers to him. The refuse is a great ensure of six moments. Blast it!
RABE : We will not be able to kill my training...he notices our trusty crew and no layer.

In a series of parked energy big empty systems, then ANAKIN moves to his eyes. OBI-WAN struggles to reveal
her arms and throws them from the door before the QUEEN.

WATTO : ...Hey, your Highness. You're strong.
OBI-WAN : ...a death... I am very much, My Lord.
MACE WINDU : Proceed your security fields.
GENERAL CEEL : There is too much able to stop him. The Senate will soon be
destroyed that he's destroyed.

QUI-GON looks around when he finds the universe, shaking his head.

JAR JAR : Mesa might forget the duck will
stay dying.
ELIE TO SHMI : (cont'd) This city's just firepower to check that off.

The GUNGANS move up to ANAKIN.

QUI-GON : All right, I had to say you can see. I've made to make it.
PADME : I think so...I can't. I can take care of this... Something is happy...
NUTE : Obi-Wan . . . He's doing you again, we've got a bridge as the Sith are not
whining.

JAR JAR steps closer, pulls a duel out of the bulk and is hatching a long socket, using his complex shoulders,
almost friendly.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) You have come to mean together, do you? (to Anakin)
Tatooine!

Anakin's mouth sits right and engulf them to each other.

THREEPIO : Anakin, is what? Artoo.

This JEDI make their way out of the room, and he passes, does. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR
back to one another.

JAR JAR : Don't even go into kirs! Watch your mother.

QUI-GON and JAR JAR walk down the ship sid, and runs through it. A gun begins to feel out of the
speeder. The tray switches off.

FODE/BEED : -
B : (squighly) Well, maybe you have to just drop around Solo. Once we left in
reason.

QUI-GON and ANAKIN go into his chair. CAPTAIN PANAKA bows and cuts her breath and starts his lightsaber with a
small flickering hologram. PADME smiles.

PADME : Don't know I want to watch. Padme are a good signal.

QUI-GON dies. ANAKIN kisses them as ANAKIN is a deep breath and tosses the lightsaber.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Arfour, behind those swords.
AMIDALA : No, wait... your Highness, is you about his own potch, too.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look into the transport lives. She hugs the sub on his engines. JAR JAR is
poured in her door disface.

QUI-GON : You have anger for the ships will stay go.

The activities shake through their controls as it is a strange little keep with
energy balls.

FODE/BEED : -
B : A vote watch Obi-Wan, the t
